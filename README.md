Data Modelling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site..

Data Engineering
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:
Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row. 
-- schema code is found in 2.ERD/ERD_code

Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table - this was done using pgAdmin4 import/export data 

Data Analysis
